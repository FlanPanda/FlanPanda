## Self Introduction
- 👋 Hi, I’m Francis
- 🌏 I'm from Hong Kong 
- 🎓 I graduated from business school and am currently working as a product developer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to develop my first site using basic HTML, CSS and Javascript
- 🤢 I've been struggling from procrastination, feeling lost about where to start, and just easily be distracted by absolutely anything
- 😍 I love video games such as AOE2 and Stardew Valley, and shows like B99
- 🤡 Need to keep reminding myself that any big achievements come from small steps one day at a time
